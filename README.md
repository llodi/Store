<br><br>
There is no API and server logic, just static data with keeping data in realm DB. <br>
Controller and UI logic are implemented here.<br><br>
Also I implemented custom ModalViewController with custom transition to choose quantity of a position with option: 
    UICustomTransitionFromBottomOptions - view is shown from the bottom<br>
    UICustomTransitionCentrallyOptions - view is shown from center as in example<br>
<br>
<br><br>
You need to launch pod install
